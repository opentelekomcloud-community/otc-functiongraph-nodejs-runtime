Transferring Secret Keys through the request header
----------------------------------------------------

The key information of HTTP functions can be transferred only
through request headers.

To obtain the AK, SK, and token of an HTTP function as shown in Table 1,
perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the :fg_console:`FunctionGraph console <>` console and go
   to the details page of the HTTP function to be configured
2. Choose **Configuration** > **Advanced Settings** and enable
   **Include Keys**.
